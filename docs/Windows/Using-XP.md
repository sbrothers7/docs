# Using Windows XP

Astonishingly, it is still possible to use Windows XP when using appropriate drivers and software on the newest machines (but I still recommend using it inside a VM). Below are steps to get you started on installing and using Windows XP—If, for some reason, you are like me and want to be abnormal.

## Installation

## Getting Started

Windows XP comes with Internet Explorer 6. With it, web browsing is possible, but incredibly limited. It can still render sites that use the http:// protocol, so we can use it to download another browser.

I personally recommend [supermium](https://win32subsystems.live/supermium).

### Activation

### Antivirus

Using this, download [One-Core-API](https://github.com/shorthorn-project/One-Core-API-Binaries). This allows you to run modern software on older Windows versions.
