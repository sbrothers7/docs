# Using Windows XP

Astonishingly, it is still possible to use Windows XP when using appropriate drivers and software on the newest machines (but I still recommend using it inside a VM). Below are steps to get you started on installing and using Windows XP—If, for some reason, you plan on (close to) daily-driving Windows XP.

## Installation

Intallation for XP is pretty much limited to old machines from the XP-era, but it is still possible to boot and run XP natively on some modern systems.

## Getting Started

Windows XP comes with Internet Explorer 6. With it, web browsing is possible, but incredibly limited. It can still render sites that use the http:// protocol, so we can use it to download another browser.

I personally recommend [supermium](https://win32subsystems.live/supermium).

### Activation

You can activate both the x86 and x86-64 versions of XP with the [xp_activate32.exe](https://archive.org/download/xp_activate32_202305) tool.

1. In the activation window, choose: *Yes, I want to telephone a customer service representative to activate Windows*.
2. Open xp_activate32.exe and enter the installation ID given.
3. Enter the generated confirmation ID (Store to the system may not work on x86-64 versions).

### Antivirus

Using this, download [One-Core-API](https://github.com/shorthorn-project/One-Core-API-Binaries). This allows you to run modern software on older Windows versions.
