# Windows Versions

!!! Tip
    "Unless you have actual reasons to use Windows, (like school/business reasons—NO gaming does NOT count), please don't install non-free microsoft spyware. No matter what you do, you are still using a proprietary operating system where you don't know what is going on in the background and you have no choice over what decision Microsoft makes.
    At least use an operating system that gives some level of respect to the user's freedom—which would be any linux distro.
    If you want 100% free software, look at FSF certified distros."

## Windows 11

### Debloating

Windows 11 comes with too many unnecessary pre-installed apps and forced telemetry that is hard to remove. Thankfully, there are utilities that removes them for you.

!!! Caution
    Removing key Windows components can break the OS, therefore the tools should be used at your own risk.

Use [CTT winutil](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil) to debloat.  
If you are a normie: [Talon](https://ravendevteam.org/software/talon/) (based on CTT winutil and other utilities)

### Key Binding

If only Karabiner was available for Windows...  
There are many to choose from, but I found [capsicain](https://github.com/cajhin/capsicain) to be most easy to use and configure.
There is also [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) which is available on all platforms.

## Windows 10
!!! Note
    Support for Windows 10 officially ended in October 14, 2025, but you can still use it normally (kind of).

### Windows LTSC

Microsoft still maintains Windows 10 LTSC builds, and the IoT version will receive security updates until 2031.
You can find the ISO at the [MAS website](https://massgrave.dev/windows_ltsc_links).

## Using Windows 7

## Using Windows XP

Astonishingly, it is still possible to use Windows XP when using appropriate drivers and software on the newest machines (but I still recommend using it inside a VM). Below are steps to get you started on installing and using Windows XP—If, for some reason, you are like me and want to be abnormal.

## Installation

## Getting Started

Windows XP comes with Internet Explorer 6. With it, web browsing is possible, but incredibly limited. It can still render sites that use the http:// protocol, so we can use it to download another browser.

I personally recommend [supermium](https://win32subsystems.live/supermium).

### Activation

### Antivirus

Using this, download [One-Core-API](https://github.com/shorthorn-project/One-Core-API-Binaries). This allows you to run modern software on older Windows versions.
