# DJMAX

## Installation

!!! Note
    Crossover requires a paid subscription

!!! Tip
    It is completely viable to download DJMAX from Steam run with Crossover without having to transfer files, but I have noticed consitently high CPU usage while downloading with Crossover and had to use a charger during install.

1. Install Crossover
`brew install --cask crossover`
2. [Install Steam on Sikarugir](../macOS/Other/Sikarugir)
3. Download DJMAX on Steam run with Sikarugir
4. Open Crossover
5. Click *Install*
6. Select Steam, then Click *Install*
7. Go through the installation process
8. Go to Bottles > Bottle Actions > Open C: Drive
9. Open Steam folder in sikarugir (found in `~/Applications/Sikarugir/yourWrapperName.app/Contents/SharedSupport/prefix/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Steam`)
10. Replace the Steam folder for Crossover with the sikarugir folder
