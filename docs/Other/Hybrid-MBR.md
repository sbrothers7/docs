# Hybrid MBR

## Why?

If you're like me and you only have 1 SSD formatted with GPT and you want to install a legacy operating system on your computer, you might want to consider Hybrid MBR ~~or just buy a new SSD if you're rich~~.
Refer to the [gparted docs](https://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/hybrid.html) for more info.
