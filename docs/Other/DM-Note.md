# DM Note

*A key viewer built for DJMAX that is highly customizable with Javascript and CSS.*

## Installation

Currently, DM Note is available for [Windows and MacOS](https://github.com/DmNote-App/DmNote/releases), and a [fork](https://github.com/northernorca/DmNote) is available for Linux.

## Making an ADOFAI Key Viewer

The KPS and Totals keys can be made with by Right Clicking an empty space, then selecting *Add Stats*.
Rain settings are under *Etc>Note Settings* (click the small arrow next to the settings icon)

Alternatively, you can download [one my presets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V23Wgd1RdNyCW5GGB_jS-cmJWbPuEDd7?usp=drive_link).
