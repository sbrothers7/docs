# DM Note

*A key viewer built for DJMAX that is highly customizable with Javascript and CSS.*

## Installation

Currently, DM Note is available for [Windows and MacOS](https://github.com/DmNote-App/DmNote/releases), and a [fork](https://github.com/northernorca/DmNote) is available for Linux.

## KPS and Totals for ADOFAI

Using the KPS plugin (either kps.js or kps-builtin.js) from the repository cannot yield common key viewer layouts used for ADOFAI and border customization is limited. You can either:

- Add customizability to the plugin (you can add settings menu)
- Use my plugin :)
